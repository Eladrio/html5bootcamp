Add doctype to the previously created HTML documents. See what happens if you remove it.

	If you remove the doctype from an HTML doc it will enter in "quirks" modes, in this
	mode it will try to emulate a lot of the bugs present in a 90's webpages. It is not
	consistent in doing this so you will get different results in different web browsers.


Add the meta viewport tag. Check what happens in a mobile browser with or without it.

	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
	Sets the browser window to the size of the device screen.
	Without it in mobile the page will "go out of the screen".
