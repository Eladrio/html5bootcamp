In the exercise 6.6 we are asked:

	Question: How could you add weight to the global font definition to win over the
	classes added by point 3.

	Answer:You can give the <html> tag an id, like <html id="global"> so in CSS you
 	select by (#global *) and then because is an id and id's have higher specificity
	than classes it will override the rules defined by the classes added in point 3.

	You could use the !important attribute but that is considered a bad practice.

In the excersise 6.7 we are asked:

	Question: Imagine there is a declaration like class="oh-no-inline-styles"
	style="background:red" and you need to change the background to green without
	changing the inline style. How could you accomplish this?

	Answer: The only think I can think of is to use the !important attribute. I know
	is a bad practice but is the only think I can think of to override an in-line
	style.
